# hpb2gv-ds2002-final-project
This is my submission for the final project for DS2002 in the Fall 2024 semester.

# Installation and Requirements
Note that to run this code, you will need both my final_data stuff and my sakila data warehouse I created from the midterm. I have included both - simply drop the final_data in FileStore for DBFS. For the sakila data warehouse, I have included a dump file that can be imported in MySQL using the Server > Data Import feature. Note that you will need to name it sakila2 for this to work.

Once you have done that, changing the values of the MySQL login instance and the MongoDB cluster information should allow you to run the code yourself. The remainder of the code should work as I have tested and re-ran it to ensure proper functionality, as well as authored a gold table to demonstrate the business value of my solution.
